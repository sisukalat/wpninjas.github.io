# Show Development

## To Do

* Need images for caricatures (Kevin, Jeremy, James)

* Contract artist

* Write a new intro (anyone want to take a stab at this? Needs to be about 10 seconds long) - I LOVE THE ORIGINAL INTRO, "WHEN SERIOUS BUSINESS IS A LAUGHING MATTER" SO, I'LL MESS WITH WRITING ONE THAT HAS ALL OUR NAMES - It can be longer than 10 minutes. It will just require me to edit the track to create more loop pace for whatever we need.

* Prerecorded Outro (? - I used one today, but not sure I'm in love with it.) - Who was the original voiceover guy? Do we still have access to him? Fiver :)

* Update cover art

* Update website

## Possible Segments

* Recommendations

* In The News

# Episode 5 (2/23/2018)

**Main Topic: **???

**Possible Segments:**

* Recommendations (If everyone could bring one recommendation of a tip, book, product, service, or resource to help the entrepreneur or small business owner.)

* In The News

    * GOOGLE AUTOCOMPLETE STILL MAKES VILE SUGGESTIONS : [https://www.wired.com/story/google-autocomplete-vile-suggestions/](https://www.wired.com/story/google-autocomplete-vile-suggestions/)

        * With the above article I think we could discuss the moral and ethical responsibilities we have to users and the larger world as business owners. And just generally riff on some of the other connected implications of this story.
